# AdsGPT plugin privacy policy

This policy covers the AdsGPT plugin for AI clients, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Claude and Grok, and
the AdsGPT MCP server it connects to (`https://mcp.adsgpt.dev`). AdsGPT is operated by Wortise
("we"). The plugin itself collects nothing on your device: it contains the skills the model reads
and the address of the MCP server. Everything below happens on the AdsGPT server when your AI client
calls one of its tools.

AdsGPT is a tool for advertisers to manage their own ad campaigns. It does not show ads to you or
inside your AI client, and it does not use your data for advertising.

## Personal data we collect

- **Account data:** your name, email address and the organization and role you have in AdsGPT,
  from your AdsGPT account.
- **Authorization data:** the AI client you connected, its OAuth registration, the access you
  approved (`ads:read`, `ads:write`) and the tokens we issued to it.
- **Tool inputs:** what your AI client's model sends to each tool, such as ad account IDs, report
  periods and queries, campaign plans, ad texts, image URLs, YouTube links and landing page URLs.
  We never receive your conversation with the AI client.
- **Ad platform data:** the data of the ad accounts your organization connected, such as campaigns,
  ads, budgets and their performance, which we read through each platform's API when a tool needs
  it.
- **Technical data:** the IP address and the time of each request, for security and to limit abuse.

We do not ask for or collect payment card data, health data, government identifiers or passwords.

## How we use it

- To sign you in and to act only for the member, organization and access you approved.
- To run the tools your AI client calls: read reports, make the changes you approve and create the
  campaigns you approve, in the ad accounts your organization connected.
- To keep, in your organization, the campaign plans, their ads and a log of every change made to
  your ad accounts: what changed, what it had before, and the member and AI client it came from.
- To keep AdsGPT secure, prevent abuse and fix errors.

We do not sell your data, use it for advertising, or use it to train AI models.

## Who receives it

- **The ad platforms your organization connected,** such as Google Ads, through their APIs and with
  the access your organization granted: the queries, reports and changes your AI client asks for,
  and the images a campaign plan uploads to the ad account.
- **Your AI client and its provider,** such as OpenAI or Anthropic, which receive the results of
  the tools they call and handle them under their own privacy policies.
- **The websites of the images you give by URL,** which we download to check them and upload them
  to your ad account.
- **Service providers that host and run AdsGPT,** such as cloud hosting and database providers,
  which process data only on our behalf.
- **Authorities,** only when the law requires it.

## How long we keep it

- **Authorization data:** until the tokens expire or you revoke the AI client's access.
- **Account data:** while your AdsGPT account exists. When you delete your account, we delete it.
- **Campaign plans, ads and the change log:** while your organization uses AdsGPT, so its members
  can review what was done. We delete them within 30 days of your organization asking us to.
- **Technical data:** with your sign-in sessions until they end, and in server logs for up to 30
  days.
- **Ad platform data:** we read it from each platform when a tool needs it and do not keep a copy,
  except what a campaign plan or the change log contains.

We may keep data longer only when the law requires it.

## Your choices and controls

- Every tool that changes an ad account asks for your approval in your AI client before it runs.
- Revoke an AI client's access from AdsGPT, or remove the AdsGPT plugin or server from your AI
  client, at any time.
- Disconnect an ad platform from the **Plugins** screen of AdsGPT at any time.
- Delete your AdsGPT account from your profile settings.
- Ask us to access, correct, export or delete your data, or your organization's, by writing to
  [hello@adsgpt.dev](mailto:hello@adsgpt.dev).

## Changes

We will update this policy when the plugin changes what it collects or how it uses it, and publish
the new version here.
