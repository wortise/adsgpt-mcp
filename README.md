# Wortise agent plugins

The plugins Wortise publishes for AI agents such as Claude, Codex and Grok. Each plugin lives in
its own folder under `plugins/`, with a manifest for each client, and this repository is the
marketplace that lists them.

| Plugin                        | What it does                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [AdsGPT](plugins/adsgpt)      | Create, review and optimize ad campaigns on the ad platforms connected to AdsGPT, such as Google Ads.     |
